🧹 04. Reaction of Intermediary Structures and Pressure Response in the Transfer System

---

📌 Purpose and Background

This section explains the structural changes and pressure responses occurring at intermediary points (B/C) during the mass transfer from A (black hole) to D (neutron star) within the D-axis structure.

🔄 Structural Response During Pressure Transfer

🌐 Assumed Scenario:

Main transfer path: A1 → B1 → C1 → D1

Alternate path: A2 → B2 → C2 → D2

A2 is absorbed into A1 → transfer pressure doubles

Mass originally traveling through B2/C2/D2 merges into A1 system → redirected through B1/C1 toward D1

---

⚠ Impact on Intermediary Structures

B1 and C1 are magnetic intermediary points, not final compression sites

The increased pressure exceeds the structural tolerance of B1/C1

---

💥 Location of Supernova Explosion

B1 or C1 collapses under excess compression

Energy leaks into surrounding space → high-energy burst

Result: Observed as a supernova explosion

---

🔄 Path Reformation and Shortening

Transfer route is restructured to bypass the collapse site

New path: A1 →→→ D1 (skipping damaged B1/C1)

Auto-reformation maintains structural integrity of D-axis

---

❗ Observational Misconception and Clarification

D1 (true neutron star) appears near the center of the explosion post-transfer

→ Not the cause of the explosion, but the stabilized structure after transfer

Meanwhile, fragments of B1 or C1 may be ejected

→ These are residual intermediary magnetic structures

→ May be misinterpreted as neutron star remnants

Therefore:

Explosion center ≈ Neutron star-like object (B1 remnant)

Post-explosion appearance ≈ Neutron star (D1) → Often misunderstood as "neutron star explosion"

---

✅ Logical Consistency and D-Axis Stability

D1 cannot collapse or disappear due to its structural pairing with A1

Only intermediary structures (B1/C1) are susceptible to collapse

Once path shortens and repairs, D1 stabilizes in its new trajectory

Supernova explosions are not stellar death events, but side reactions in pressure transfer systems

---

🧠 Summary

Intermediary points B/C serve as mass transfer conduits, not end points

Mergers (e.g., black hole fusion) can increase pressure and cause intermediary collapse → supernova

Residuals near supernova sites may resemble neutron stars but are actually intermediary remnants

True neutron stars (D1) appear near the explosion zone post-event, but are not the source of the explosion
