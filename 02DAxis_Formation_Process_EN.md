# ðŸ”§ D-Axis Structure Formation Process

---

## ðŸ“Œ Preconditions in Cosmic Space

- Space contains countless micro-masses (cosmic dust, failed cores, comets, etc.)
- Accidental collisions between masses cause high-energy reactions
- These reactions leave magnetic traces in space

---

## ðŸš© Birth of the First Magnetic Body (Neutron Star D)

- Collision between large and moving masses â†’ magnetic core forms
- Possesses the strongest and most stable magnetic field â†’ settles as Neutron Star D

---

## ðŸš§ Formation of Intermediate Relay Points (B/C)

- Scattered minor masses from collisions re-collide
- Repeated interactions create multiple weak magnetic bodies
- These are arranged along the path toward D, functioning as B/C points

---

## âš« Formation of the Final Convergence Point (Black Hole A)

- Remaining core continues to collapse, surpasses electron density threshold
- Generates spontaneous inductive structure â†’ becomes Black Hole A

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Establishment of the Aâ†’D Pathway

- Electron induction and tensor compression from A passes through B/C structures
- Guided toward D without spatial resistance â†’ established as a mass transfer path

## ðŸ§  Significance

Unlike conventional models that assume "sudden events" or "isolated formations",  
this formation process demonstrates a **stepwise spatial response-based structure**.  
The D-Axis structure is understood not as a "sudden event", but as the "result of a structured process".
